Title: Face Mask Detection using CNN, Deep Learning and Computer Vision

Problem Statement: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus. However, ensuring that people wear masks properly and consistently can be a challenge. This project aims to develop a solution using deep learning and transfer learning to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not, and whether they are wearing it correctly.

Solution: We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for our face mask detection system. We utilized transfer learning to fine-tune an existing pre-trained model, specifically the MobileNetV2 architecture, for our specific problem. We trained the model on a dataset of images of people wearing masks and not wearing masks, using data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the model. The model takes an input image, and outputs a prediction of whether the person is wearing a mask or not, and whether they are wearing it correctly.

Metrics: We evaluated our model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our model achieved an accuracy of over 98%, precision of 99%, recall of 98%, and F1 score of 98%.

Use Cases:

Health Care Facilities: The face mask detection system can be installed at health care facilities to ensure that patients, visitors, and staff wear masks properly and consistently.

Public Transport: The system can be used at bus and train stations to detect whether passengers are wearing masks before they board public transport.

Retail Stores: Retail stores can use the system to ensure that customers wear masks before entering the store.

Conclusion: In conclusion, we have developed a face mask detection system using CNN deep learning and transfer learning that can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not, and whether they are wearing it correctly. The system has several potential use cases, including in health care facilities, public transport, and retail stores. With further development, this technology could play an important role in helping to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses.
